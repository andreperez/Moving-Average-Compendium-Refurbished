# Moving Average Compendium Refurbished

This is my effort to bring together in a single script the widest range of moving averages possible.
I aggregated the calculation of averages within a library.

For more information about the library follow the link:

[Moving Averages Proxy](https://github.com/andreperez/Moving-Averages-Proxy)

Basically this indicator is the visual result of this library.

You can choose the moving average and the script updates the chart as per the type.

The unique parameters of certain moving averages remain at their default values.

To have a rainbow of moving averages I also made an indicator:
